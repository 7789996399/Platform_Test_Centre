  "source_transcript": "Good morning Mr. Jackson, I'm Dr. Raubenheimer. I see you're here for your pre-op assessment for your aortic valve surgery. How are you feeling today? [Patient: Pretty good, just get a bit winded going up stairs.] How many flights can you climb? [Patient: About one, then I need to rest.] Any chest pain? [Patient: No, not really.] Any passing out or feeling like you might pass out? [Patient: No.] Good. Let me check your medications - you're on metoprolol? [Patient: Yes, 50 twice a day.] And lisinopril? [Patient: Yes, 10 in the morning.] Aspirin? [Patient: The baby aspirin, yes.] Any allergies to medications? [Patient: None that I know of.] Great. Your echo from last month shows moderate aortic stenosis with a valve area of 1.1 cm squared. We'll proceed with the AVR as planned for next Tuesday. Keep taking your metoprolol - that's important around surgery."
