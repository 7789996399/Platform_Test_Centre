  "source_transcript": "Good afternoon Mrs. Garcia. I'm Dr. Raubenheimer, the anesthesiologist. You're here for your pre-op before your bypass surgery. How are you feeling? [Patient: Nervous but ready to get it done.] I understand. Any chest pain recently? [Patient: Yes, when I walk too far or climb stairs. Goes away when I rest.] Good that it goes away with rest. Now, your heart cath showed three-vessel disease, and your heart function is about 45%, which is a bit reduced. Let me go through your medications. Metoprolol? [Patient: Yes, 25 twice a day.] Lisinopril? [Patient: 5 milligrams in the morning.] Aspirin? [Patient: 325, one a day.] Plavix? [Patient: Yes, 75.] Any blood thinners like warfarin or Eliquis? [Patient: No, just the aspirin and Plavix.] Any allergies? [Patient: Penicillin gives me a rash.] Any other allergies? [Patient: No, just that one.] Okay. I see you had a heart attack back in 2020 and had a stent placed. Any irregular heartbeats? [Patient: Sometimes my heart races but it hasn't happened in a while.] We'll watch for that. Your blood pressure today is 145/88, heart rate 72. Rhythm sounds a bit irregular. No swelling in your legs. We'll need to stop the Plavix five days before surgery."
